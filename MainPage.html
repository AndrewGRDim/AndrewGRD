<h1> My website </h1>

<p> 	My name is Andrew Dimock. The purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio with a list of my goals and projects as I educate myself on IT and Cyber Security, and eventually break into the job market.<p>

<h4> Why does it look like this? </h4>

<p> 	Instead of using a site building platform that builds the site easily and asthetically, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn to write and understand HTML at a deeper level. I find this much more rewarding than the convenient alternative. </p>

<p> 	I made this HTML file on a VM with the Ubuntu Linux OS installed. I'm using a text/code editor named Sublime Text. </p>

<h4> Current Goals </h4>
<p> Attain CompTIA A+ Certficate </p>
<p> Continue to learn about Linux OS </p>
